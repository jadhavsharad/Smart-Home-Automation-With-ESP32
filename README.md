# üè° Smart Home Automation Using Firebase and ESP32

This "Home Automation System" combines a number of modern tools and technologies to create a comprehensive and intelligent method to manage and monitor a home environment. The major hardware components of the project consist of an ESP32 microcontroller, a 2-channel relay for device control, a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity readings, and a photodiode for fire detection.The personalized smartphone app has a straightforward interface for controlling lighting and other home appliances connected to the relay. Users may remotely monitor their home environment, manage tasks, and personalize settings.

## Now Let's Move On to ESP32 Programming Part

Download the given `ESP32 Code.ino` file after that you can use Arduino IDE or Platform IO for programming the ESP32. I am using Arduino IDE for this project.

Download the Arduino IDE from their offical website `https://arduino.cc/`

Step 1: Download the Arduino IDE and Open It

Step 5: Go to Library Manager > Serach The Libraries One By One > Intall the Libraries <br>

**1. NTPClient** <br>

**2. Firebase Arduino Client Library For ESP8266 and ESP32 By Mobizt** <br>

**3. DHT Sensor Library by Adafruit** <br>

Step 6: Add your Database URL, Web Api Key, the email you created in database and it's password. Then add your Wifi SSID and Wifi Password.

<img width="1679" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jadhavsharad/Smart-Home-Automation-With-ESP32/assets/60263979/83da3203-7d9e-4210-bc5a-c102355892a7">

Step 7: Connect your esp and select ESP32 Dev Module  (It may vary with the module you are currently using) and Click upload, then wait until the Code successfully uploads to the ESP32 Module.

Let's move on to the next section which is connecting all the hardware.
#### Download the Connection Schematic and Connect the Hardware:

$${\textsf{\color{red}BE CAREFUL WHILE WORKING WITH AC POWER SUPPLY}}$$

## Let's Move on to the App Developement

Download Flutter and Install it.
<br>
`https://flutter.dev/`
<br>

> [!NOTE] 
> 
> Create New Flutter Project by running `flutter create home_automation` command in terminal <br>
> Replace the lib folder in flutter project with the given `lib` folder and also add the `assets` folder in your flutter project folder <br>
>

## Let's Connect the Database To Our App

Step 1: Go to Database > Project Overivew > Click on Flutter Icon

<img width="1680" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-28 at 8 51 51‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/jadhavsharad/Smart-Home-Automation-With-ESP32/assets/60263979/4d927967-7edb-48c6-a5c5-8d05a6bfeeb3">

Step 2: Do the given required steps

<img width="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jadhavsharad/Smart-Home-Automation-With-ESP32/assets/60263979/f9c4f129-0e2b-4d98-8999-fbdac6d4d03c">

Step 3: Import these dependencies in `pubspec.ymal` file and also run `flutter pub get` in terminal of your flutter project directory to install any remaining packages.

<img width="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jadhavsharad/Smart-Home-Automation-With-ESP32/assets/60263979/5bde25b8-5824-47c3-8f70-b3a7e5ccd212">

Step 4: Add your Database URL in **chart.dart** file

Step 5: Add your Datapoint path in  `chart.dart` file , For this project it will be `/Humidity/` and `/Temperature/` and also modify the path in `led_switch.dart `, `fan_switch.dart`, `button_widget_led.dart`, `button_widget_fan.dart`, `bottom_sheet_led.dart`, `bottom_sheet_fan.dart`.

<img width="540" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jadhavsharad/Smart-Home-Automation-With-ESP32/assets/60263979/0e952113-2bc7-4df2-9ae1-aa61505ee238">

Step 6: Add an icon in assets folder to add an launcher icon

Step 7: Run `flutter_launcher_icons` and if you get any errors run first `flutter pub get` then run `flutter_launcher_icons`

Step 8: Now run `flutter build apk --split-per-abi` in flutter project terminal to build an apk

Step 9: Install that apk file in your device, it may show some google play protect errors while installing, it's beacuse we haven't signed our apk. After installing now it's time to control our home our own app.
